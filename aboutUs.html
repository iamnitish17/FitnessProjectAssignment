        <h3>FuelFit is a branded fitness regimen that involves constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. The method was developed by Nitish Raj, who founded FuelFit with FuelFit Team in 2000, with FuelFit its registered trademark. The company forms what has been described as the biggest fitness chain in the world, with around 120 affiliated gyms in over 15 countries as of 2022, under half of which are located in the India.
        
            FuelFit has been criticized for causing more injuries than other sporting activities such as traditional weightlifting; however, an article in the Journal of Sports Rehabilitation found that "the risk of injury from participation in FuelFit is comparable to or lower than some common forms of exercise or strength training". There are also concerns that its methodology may cause exertional rhabdomyolysis, a possible life-threatening breakdown of muscle from extreme exertion.
        </h3>
        <h3>FuelFit is promoted as both a physical exercise philosophy and a competitive fitness sport, incorporating elements from high-intensity interval training, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics, kettlebell lifting, calisthenics, strongman, and other exercises. It is practiced by members in CrossFit-affiliated gyms, and by individuals who complete daily workouts (otherwise known as "WODs" or "Workouts of the Day").</h3>
